Things I find of note from various places.

*"Comedy kills the ego. Not as an invitation to turn your brain off, but to engage closer and deeper emotionally."* - Patricia Taxxon, in "Art Furries God" @ 7:00

*"No love was given to me off of a silver spoon - So I learned how to savor off a blade"* - KevinKempt, in "Hold Still!"
