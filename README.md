# vore-research
### This is a research vault for collaborative art project "VORE IS BEAUTIFUL". Best viewed in Obsidian.

`broad` tag: For research that is very broad, something that is "above" other research topics. (ex. "drawings")
`precise` tag: For research with a precise focus on a certain aspect of the research. (ex. "death's relationship with vore")
`recategorize` tag: For a note that, later on, has a chance to be better suited as a category within another note. Use if you feel an idea only *might* have a lot to extract.
