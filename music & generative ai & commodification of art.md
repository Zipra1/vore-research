A lot of people see music as just the song/album you get on streaming services, or in a cassette/cd/vinyl/etc...
I would argue that a single song, listened to after the making, is not the full song. The full song is the jam sesh before. The demo from it, to the final production of it. It's a layer deeper into the art, something that can't be experienced by just listening to it.
Art is an action. What you are consuming on streaming platforms and deviantart is the result of the intentions and feelings that arose during that action; a byproduct.

I think that in every art piece is a "chain of experience":
At the center of it, is the "product" : the commodity portion of the art. What can be bought, sold, generated. On the tail end, is the process of creating it. What it took to create, the nuance that was lost in translation, the emotions that nobody but the creator felt for it. And then on the front end, the interpretation of the art. The emotions after translation, what the viewer takes away from it. The front end is not to be confused with the tail end, you can only see a blurry photo of the tail from the front. And you can never directly see the center.

Art can also take on a story of its own like the Mona Lisa, but that is something I don't feel the need to touch on here.

The commodification of art removes half the fucking thing! All you get is the center and the front! There's a void beneath AI art, a vacuum.

`This thought was spurred by the thought of art being a commodity: which i strongly disagree with as of 20250518.`
