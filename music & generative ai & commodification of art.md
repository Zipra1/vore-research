A lot of people see music as just the song/album you get on streaming services, or in a cassette/cd/vinyl/etc...
I would argue that a single song, listened to after the making, is not the full song. The full song is the jam sesh before. The demo from it, to the final production of it. It's a layer deeper into the art, something that can't be experienced by just listening to it.
Art is an action. What you are consuming on streaming platforms and deviantart is the result of the intentions and feelings that arose during that action; a byproduct.

When engaging with art deeply after the fact, you get another "layer" to it that you don't get by just Looking at it or Listening to it. Immersing yourself in the art --> [[god outside-in of god]]

`This thought was spurred by the thought of art being a commodity: which i strongly disagree with as of 20250518.`
