Why is vore so often just about furries? What's the connection?
Is it [[Fantasy through art]]? Does the furry enhance the fantastical nature?

Is it that vore is based in feeling outcast (lovingly suicidal? [[Comfort of being eaten]]), #death and therefore related to one of the pillars of furry (neurodivergency)?
The pillars of furry and its relation to vore
### The sensory
Vore is inherently a very intense sensory experience, that may be particularly valuable to furries.

### The symbolic
Vore symbolizes. a lot of things. Becoming one, love, the consumption of a part of you that comes with it.

### The ever so slightly autistic
If vore is to be considered comfortable in part due to the [[Comfort of being eaten]]:`lovingly suicidal` and #death, is it OK to assume that loneliness and feeling outcast can contribute to wanting to be vored?
