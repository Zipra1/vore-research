## vore is love <3
#precise 
quote from CJ The X's "6 Shapes of God" at ~1:04:00 "To love something is to be committed to it, as something bigger than you that you wanna be subsumed inside of." #love 
"Loving is identifying with something outside of you; Loving something doesn't mean that you care about what it cares about, it means that you consider it part of you."
