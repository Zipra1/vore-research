quote from CJ The X's "6 Shapes of God" at ~1:04:00 and onward. The love section. 
TODO: Go back and find the sources of these quotes and look at those.

"To love something is to be committed to it, as something bigger than you that you wanna be subsumed inside of." #love 
"Loving is identifying with something outside of you; Loving something doesn't mean that you care about what it cares about, it means that you consider it part of you."
"Love is the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth" : The fursona is the spirit

*A fursona is an externalization of ones spirit. Something that allows them to be internally free, not limited by a strict human form. Vore is the externalization of the spirit in love.* #furry
