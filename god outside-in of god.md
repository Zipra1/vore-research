relating too [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZg_36utl2w&ab_channel=CJTheX) video by cj the x. more specifically the existential kink thing.
*Vore is a fantasy kink. Given it is impossible in reality, it exists only in the mind. Vore turns you into God, and God is super fucking into this. It's not weird, it's God playing with Himself and His toys that he creates to feel both pleasure and pain in equal proportion. But in His new world, pain becomes pleasure. And when God annihilates his new world, with Him comes the pearl at the center of His universe. The ability to turn pain in to pleasure where-ever He chooses. The ability to disrupt the yin and yang.* #god `"pleasure and pain in equal proportion" is a corru quote from God. They could be good imagery for that.`

*as an all powerful being, i choose to be an all-powerful being.* : the urge to

under this lens, vore can be seen as:
- Empowering
- Interesting, existentially. In a god outside-in of god way.
- A way to entirely disconnect(reconnect to the existential?) from life: *sleep?* *is this a relation to death, or is it merely coincidence that death is also disconnect and a part of some vore?* #sleep #death

When the God inside of God is empowered `in this case, via creating and consuming vore media`, does this loop back around to God or is a new God created? ie. Is this a way to disconnect, or reconnect? Is reconnection psychologically valid?
	 current conclusion: a new god is created, the disconnect life creates from the existential is doubled in the new. this conclusion allows for the existence of [[god outside-in of god#Pleasure Extraction]]

# Pleasure Extraction
Vore is used to turn pain into pleasure, while pleasure stays pleasure.. When you enter this imaginative world, you can bring back that way of existing, making every pain a bit more bareable. `I dont draw vore art because I am sexually interested (no its not just repressed i prommies). Is this why?`

Can this concept be defined as divination, **"the practice of seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown by supernatural means."**? Something similar?

```
i dont look at vore because i like to look at vore
i look at vore to extract artistic meaning from what i have, right now, deemed to be high art.
and then i extract that artistic meaning.
and now, i look at vore, because i like to look at vore.
```
15:40 "My mission in life is to stretch to the earth and learn to eat an apple and just like that for that." : Is vore a good "first step" for getting to this? Maybe even *the step*?
