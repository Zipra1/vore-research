relating too [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZg_36utl2w&ab_channel=CJTheX) video by cj the x. more specifically the existential kink thing.
*Vore is a fantasy kink. Given it is impossible in reality, it exists only in the mind. Vore turns you into God, and God is super fucking into this. It's not weird, it's God playing with Himself and His toys that he creates to feel both pleasure and pain in equal proportion.* #god `"pleasure and pain in equal proportion" is a corru quote from God. They could be good imagery for that.`

under this lens, vore can be seen as:
- Empowering
- Interesting, existentially. In a god outside-in of god way.
- A way to entirely disconnect from life: *sleep?* *is this a relation to death, or is it merely coincidence that death is also disconnect and a part of some vore?* #sleep #death
