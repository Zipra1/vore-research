In [[beastars]], #hardvore is often used as a symbol of love. #hardvore is basically sex in the [[beastars]] universe. A queer connection arises when:
1. A predator eats a male prey. Or, the existence of male prey animals at all. That's pretty self-explanatory under the presumption of "eat meat = sex"
2. A prey animal eats meat. This is interesting under the lens of vore art.
