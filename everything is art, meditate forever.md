AI art is art, as a whole. It's beautiful that someone decided to spend billions of dollars and spend unimaginable amounts of resources to make endless images that look like images people have already made. That's an incredible art piece. The process, the action, is insane. It's powerful. Its painful. It makes you feel something. Rage. Fear. Excitement for your business costs to drop by 0.05% because now you can stop paying those pesky artists and buy another supercar with what was their salary.

^^ This could be used as an alternative to vore, I guess. But vore is a better vehicle for the concept.

Everything is beautiful, when you can look at it like this. When the world before you is a canvas, everything is art.

Meditation, to me, is a way to disconnect yourself from the world and all your problems. and just. Be in the moment. For a moment. Meditation, without sitting and doing nothing, is this whole concept. #meditation
Vore can be a form of forced meditation, see [[god outside-in of god]]. a good way to get into it, maybe.
